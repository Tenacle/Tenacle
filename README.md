- 👋 Hi, I’m Tristan!
- 👀 I’m interested in coding, new tech, and etc.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to get a software dev job, kotlin, frameworks, and other dev tools.
- 💞️ I’m looking to actually finishing a project. And manage to learn a full stack worth of tools.
- 📫 How to reach me: send me a msg, if they allow that in github.
